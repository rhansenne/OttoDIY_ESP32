Otto DIY Bluetooth controller_1.0.11.apk is the original app (currently no longer available on the Play store).

Otto DIY Bluetooth controller_1.0.11_ledfix.apk contains a small modification which increases the BLE MTU size, which fixes the transmitted (mouth) LED matrix configuration being truncated and therefore not properly displayed in some cases.
This apk file is self signed however, so you may need to work around a Google Play Protect warning when installing this version of the apk.
